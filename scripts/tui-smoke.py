"""End-to-end smoke test for `comet-tui`, driven through a real pty.

The property under test is the one no unit test can reach: that the viewport and
the engine have independent lifetimes. No installed daemon or online account is
required. We start the TUI with nothing running, let it spawn a detached local
engine, do real work through it, quit, and then check the engine is *still
there* — and that reattaching finds the work.

The pty driver and terminal emulator live in `tui_capture`, shared with
`tui-screenshots.py`: ratatui addresses the cursor per changed run, so the frame
has to be reconstructed rather than grepped out of the byte stream.

Usage:  scripts/tui-smoke.py [--keep]
        --keep  leave the daemon running afterwards (for poking at by hand)
