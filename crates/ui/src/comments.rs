//! the composer and folded into the next prompt.
//!
//! The transport is deliberately the same shape as `attachments.rs`: the
//! comments ride the user message as PLAIN TEXT (see [`with_comments`]). There
//! is no second data model — nothing to persist, nothing to sync, and the
//! agent reads `path:line` in the prompt exactly as a human would. The
//! composer projects the staged set to one chip while it is being composed;
//! once sent, [`extract_badge`] lifts the same block back out for the
//! transcript (see `badges.rs`), so the reader sees that one chip again
//! rather than the bullets the agent reads.
