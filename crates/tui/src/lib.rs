//! comet-tui — the terminal viewport.
//!
//! A peer of the gpui app in `comet-ui`, not a subset of it: both are thin
//! clients over the same typed RPC (ARCHITECTURE §1). The TUI attaches or
//! spawns only the trusted local daemon, then delegates its local-first and
//! configured-remote model to `comet_client::Federation`; both viewports derive their row
//! order, status dots and gates from the same pure functions in
//! `comet_proto::view`. What differs is the renderer and one deliberate
//! architectural choice — **the TUI never embeds an engine**.
//!
//! ## Why the engine is always a separate process
//!
//! The gpui app embeds an engine when no daemon is listening, because a desktop
//! window and the work it drives have the same lifetime. A terminal does not:
//! you close it, the SSH session drops, the laptop lid shuts. So `comet-tui`
//! attaches to a daemon and starts a detached one if there isn't one
//! ([`daemon`]). Quitting the viewport is then genuinely *detaching* — agents
//! keep running in the authoritative local engine, and reattaching is instant
//! because nothing had to be rebuilt.
//!
//! ## Where the performance comes from
//!
//! Four things, in rough order of how much they matter:
//!
//! 1. **No redraw without a reason, and no more than one per frame budget.** The
//!    loop below has no tick: it sleeps in `select!` until input, an engine
//!    frame, or a deadline it armed on purpose. A burst of streaming commits is
//!    drained and collapsed into a single draw ([`Loop::pump`]).
//! 2. **Layout is cached per message and invalidated by content fingerprint**
//!    ([`transcript`]), so a streaming token re-wraps one message, not the
//!    conversation.
//! 3. **Only the visible window is built** — the transcript renders cached lines
//!    by reference, and the sidebar slices to the pane height.
//! 4. **One `write` per frame** ([`tty`]), over ratatui's cell diff, so an
//!    unchanged screen emits no bytes at all.
//!
//! The idle cost of this app is therefore zero wakeups and zero bytes, and its
//! streaming cost is bounded by the terminal size rather than by the transcript.
